In \textbf{Algorithm 1} we are dividing the arm set $A$ into smaller clusters which belong to the cluster set $S$, where after clustering $|S|=p$. We are bounding the cluster size by $\ell$ such that $\ell=\bigg\lceil \dfrac{K}{p} \bigg\rceil$ where $p$ is the number of clusters pre-specified. We randomly uniformly allocate arms in each of the clusters and this is shown in SubroutineCluster($p$).
%For creating these clusters we rely on the parameter $\epsilon_{m}$, which is initialized at $1$ and halved after every round. 
%$\hat{\Delta}_{m}$(in which all $\hat{r}_{i}$ lies) divided by $\ell$. 
%If the range before any round is found to be $0$ then we conduct a small exploration with the alternate definition of $\epsilon_{m}=\dfrac{1}{D_{m}}$. 
%Thus, we see that as the rounds progresses, $\epsilon_{m}$ gets smaller and smaller resulting in tighter and tighter clusters with high purity level. Single link clustering tends to create large clusters with many elements in a single cluster. To avoid this behavior, mainly because we are conducting exploration inside a cluster based on its size, we bound the maximum cluster size possible in any round by $\ell=\min\lbrace 2^{m}, K \rbrace$. Hence as $\epsilon_{m}$ tends to $\Delta$ the upper limit on the cluster size gets fixed. 

We can also see that at any round $m$, the pulls $n_{m}$ increases at a lesser rate compared to the round-based variants UCB-Improved $n_{m}=\bigg\lceil \dfrac{2log(T\tilde{\Delta}_{m}^{2})}{\tilde{\Delta}_{m}^{2}} \bigg\rceil$, where $\tilde{\Delta}_{m}$ is initialized at $1$ and halved after every round or Median-Elimination $\dfrac{4}{\epsilon^{2}}\log\big(\dfrac{3}{\delta}\big)$, where $\epsilon,\delta$ are the parameters for PAC guarantee.

	Next, in each of the round we eliminate arms like UCB-Improved(\cite{auer2010ucb}) or Median Elimination(\cite{even2006action}),however, it is important to note that there is no longer a single point of reference based on which we are eliminating arms but now we have as many reference points to eliminate arms as number of clusters formed that is $p$. We can be this aggressive because we have divided the larger problem into smaller sub-problems, doing local exploration and eliminating sub-optimal arms within each clusters with high guarantee. Hence, compared to UCB-Improved or Median Elimination, the proposed algorithm should have a higher probability of arm deletion. Especially when $K$ is large it is efficient to remove sub-optimal arms quickly rather getting tied down in hopeless exploration. The parameters $\rho_{a}\in (0,1]$ and $\rho_{s}\in (0,1]$ for arm and cluster elimination helps in aggressive elimination of arms and clusters respectively. At the end of each round we update all the  parameters.
%Also our total regret depends on how many arms has survived till $m$-th round and so we don't need to keep track on the number of clusters formed.

%Through cluster elimination condition we ensure that the stopping condition is reached faster. This is a much aggressive elimination condition and in the proofs we give a further analysis on why this works. The parameter $\rho\in (0,1]$ in the confidence interval actually makes the cluster elimination a faster elimination condition than the elimination condition in UCB-Improved.
	
%This is a parameter which we use to tune our exploration and we define its structure later in the proofs. There is also the weight($w_{s_{i}}$) parameter which   is calculated online and helps in eliminating arms with a higher probability which we employ to reduce the cumulative regret and this parameter is decide online specific to the cluster $s_{i}\in S$.
